upon connection:

(SERVER creates a thread with the new socket)

SERVER to CLIENT DATA : Bank.name, timestamp
CLIENT to SERVER DATA : name string to match to account.name

SERVER to CLIENT DATA : initial command request

loop until choice is 0
	CLIENT to SERVER DATA : command choice
	SERVER to CLIENT DATA : return type ( 1 for further command in the form of DATA , 2 for return of OJBECT ) /* zero is ommitted to lessen any confusion with the termination signal */
	if response is 1
		SERVER to CLIENT DATA : further options
	else if response is 2
		SERVER to CLIENT OBJECT : return object
		SERVER to CLIENT DATA : initial command request
	end if
end loop

(BOTH close and clean socket and finish thread/process)
